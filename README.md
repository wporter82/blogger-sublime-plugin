# blogger-sublime-plugin
Plugin for Sublime Text 3 that formats and posts via email. Code snippits are formatted for use with 
<a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a>.

This plugin is meant to make posting code snippits to a Blogger blog easier by auto-formatting for the web and using
SyntaxHighlighter to make it more visible. A blogpost will be coming soon showing how to set it up.
